            <h1> What is a Sign?</h1>

                <p><strong>A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.</strong></p>

            <br>
            <h1>Types of Signs:</h1>

                <p>There are five different types of signs recognized by the <strong>ANSI Z535 series of standards:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Danger Signs &#9888;</li>
                    <li> Warning Signs &#9888;</li>
                    <li> Caution Signs &#9888;</li>
                    <li> Notice Signs &#9888;</li>
                    <li> Safety Instruction Signs &#9888;</li>
                </ol>
                <!-- &#9888; represents warning sign in UTF-8  -->

            <div style= "background-color:rgb(252, 167, 167)"class="danger"><h2> Danger Signs &#9888;</h2></div>

                <p>Danger signs are specifically used for situations where a potentially deadly or otherwise serious hazard is present. These special visual communication tools feature a red background with white text and should be reserved for only the most dangerous hazards in the facility.</p>

                <p>For example, danger signs can be used in situations where arc flashes have the potential to occur. Danger signs can also be used to warn employees of cutting or blunt force hazards such as pinch points, saws, and conveyor belts.</p>
                    
                <p>These signs can save the lives of both workers and anyone else in the vicinity. Remember, simple reminders can go a long way.</p>

            <div style="background-color:rgb(248, 190, 31)"class="warning"><h2> Warning Signs &#9888;</h2></div>

                <p>One level of severity down from danger signs are warning signs. The signs have black text surrounded by an orange background and means there is a serious hazard present that could result in injury or death.</p>

                <p>Often hung up on walls at eye level or directly placed on heavy equipment, warning signs are ferry essential messages to workers about the environment they are in. These often incite the need for PPE or to stay away from the dangerous space entirely.</p>

            <div style="background-color: rgb(250, 234, 11);"class="caution"><h2>Caution Sign &#9888;</h2></div>

                <p>Caution signs, black text with a yellow background, are used for hazardous situations that if not avoided, might cause minor or moderate injury. These types of signs are seen often in public places tripping hazard signs, or “Slippery When Wet” signs.</p>

                <p>AS can be seen from this example, caution signs aren't just for manufacturing or distribution facilities. They can be used in a variety of other places to keep all kinds of people safe from minor injuries.</p>

            <div style="background-color: rgb(31, 161, 248)"class="notice"><h2> Notice Sign &#9888;</h2></div>

                <p>Notice signs are blue with white text. These types of signs are used to convey other information not related to safety and when there is no hazard present. A “no smoking” sign for instance might be placed on a warning sign if there are flammable liquids, but a blue no smoking sign means the prohibited act is not due to safety reasons.</p>

                 <p> Using safety instruction signs for objects, like first aid kits, are great for directing employees on where to go to find this item. While they provide the reader with necessary information, these signs are also enabling employees to react to an emergency quickly.</p>
